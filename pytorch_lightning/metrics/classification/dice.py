class DiceCoefficient(F1):
    """
    Computes Dice Coefficient.

    Works with binary, multiclass, and multilabel data.
    Accepts logits from a model output or integer class values in prediction.
    Works with multi-dimensional preds and target.

    Forward accepts

    - ``preds`` (float or long tensor): ``(N, ...)`` or ``(N, C, ...)`` where C is the number of classes
    - ``target`` (long tensor): ``(N, ...)``

    If preds and target are the same shape and preds is a float tensor, we use the ``self.threshold`` argument.
    This is the case for binary and multi-label logits.

    If preds has an extra dimension as in the case of multi-class scores we perform an argmax on ``dim=1``.

    Args:
        num_classes: Number of classes in the dataset.
        threshold:
            Threshold value for binary or multi-label logits. default: 0.5

        average:
            - ``'micro'`` computes metric globally
            - ``'macro'`` computes metric for each class and uniformly averages them
            - ``'weighted'`` computes metric for each class and does a weighted-average,
              where each class is weighted by their support (accounts for class imbalance)
            - ``'none'`` computes and returns the metric per class

        multilabel: If predictions are from multilabel classification.
        compute_on_step:
            Forward only calls ``update()`` and returns None if this is set to False. default: True
        dist_sync_on_step:
            Synchronize metric state across processes at each ``forward()``
            before returning the value at the step. default: False
        process_group:
            Specify the process group on which synchronization is called. default: None (which selects the entire world)

    Example:
        >>> from pytorch_lightning.metrics import F1
        >>> target = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2])
        >>> preds = torch.tensor([0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1])
        >>> f1 = F1(num_classes=3)
        >>> f1(preds, target)
        tensor(0.3333)
    """
